    <h3>Bound Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on
    Bound's app for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.</p>

    <h5>Information we collect</h5>
    <p>Bound does not transmit any identifying information to its servers
    (we do not even have servers to send information to).</p>
    <p>All personal data downloaded with Bound is stored locally.</p>
    <p>Bound does not and will never use cloud accounts for any reason except
       to the extent necessary to accomplish Bound’s functionality.</p>
    <p>All data downloaded with Bound occurs from the results of the users
      actions.</p>

    <h5>Technical basics</h5>
    <p>We use tokens in the app to keep you logged into services you link.</p>
    <p>Crash logs are collected in an anonymous fashion in order to improve
      the app.</p>

    <h5>Third Party Integration</h5>
    <p>The app does use third party services that may collect information used
       to identify you.</p>
    <p>Link to privacy policy of third party service providers used by the
      app:</p>
    <ul class="privacy-links">

      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics">Firebase Analytics</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Drive</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement">Microsoft OneDrive</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Analytics</h5>
    <p>Bound’s app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the
      percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.</p>

    <h5>Information usage</h5>
    <p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our apps and
       customer support.</p>
    <p>We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the
       extent necessary to accomplish Bound’s functionality.</p>
    <p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court
      orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or
      defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action
      regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of
      our policies; or to protect our rights and property.</p>

    <h5>Security</h5>
    <p>We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your
      information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and
      website requires HTTPS communication. Passwords are never stored, and
      use login tokens store credentials between sessions.</p>

    <h5>Deleting information</h5>
    <p>Bound does not employ user accounts and collects only anonymous
      information.</p>
    <p>Deleting Bound will stop anonymous information from being
      collected.</p>
    <p>Bound may delete anonymous information at any time and for any reason,
      such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of
      idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.</p>

    <h5>Third-party links and content</h5>
    <p>Bound downloads content from third-party cloud storage provider
      servers. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have
      no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.</p>

    <h5>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h5>
    <p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We
      therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside
      parties without your consent.</p>

    <p>We never collect or maintain information in our app from those we
      actually know are under 13, and no part of our app is structured to
      attract anyone under 13.</p>

      collect, use, and store your information outside of the European
      Union.</p>
